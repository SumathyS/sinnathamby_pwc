# A sensitivity analysis of pesticide concentrations in California Central Valley vernal pools

In this study, the Pesticide Water Calculator (PWC) model was implemented with deterministic and probabilistic approaches and parameterized for three agricultural vernal pool watersheds located in the San Joaquin River basin in the Central Valley of California.
